# Final Project

## Introduction

This is a final project for the [Interacting with Data](https://github.com/Brown-BIOL2430-S04-Fall2015/syllabus) seminar in fall 2015. This project visualizes the relationships between different population genetic summary statistics for inferring selection in the genome, using a simulated dataset with examples of SNPs under neutrality, hard sweeps, linked to hard sweeps, soft sweeps, and linked to soft sweeps.

To view this project, ... (will finish later)<!---(embed visualization here or provide instructions on how to view the project).--->

## The data

The dataset of summary statistics for sites evolving under models of neutrality, hard sweeps (selective sweeps from *de novo* mutations), and soft sweeps (selective sweeps from standing genetic variation) were simulated using the population genetic simulator *msms* (Ewing and Hermisson 2010) based on the human demographic model from Gravel et al. (2011). A representative subset of 2500 sites for each of five classes (neutral, hard sweep, linked to hard sweeps, soft sweeps, linked to soft sweeps) were used to make the visualization. Each row in the dataset corresponds to a simulated SNP, where the first column is the class label for the SNP, and the remaining columns are population genetic summary statistics for inferring selection at the SNP. Statistics include estimators of the population mutation rate theta, site frequency spectrum tests, linkage disequlibrium tests, population differentiation tests, haplotype frequency spectrum tests, and extended haplotype homozygosity (EHH) computed using the software *selscan* (Szpiech and Hernandez 2014). Based on unpublished work.

## Background



<!---Examples of previous visualizations of similar data or processes, if any exist... Include links or add images to markdown document... how were data mapped to aesthetics in these previous approaches? Was there filtering?--->

<!---Shortcomings of previous approaches, or potentially interesting gaps between previous approaches...--->

## This project

### Mapping of data to aesthetics

<!---How will aesthetic attributes ( X / Y / color / shape / size /texture / etc ) will be mapped to the data?--->

### Filtering

<!---Are data filtered? ie in some views are some data not mapped to particular attributes of the image? What is the goal of the filtering?--->

### Extra ink

<!---Are there aesthetic attributes that are not mapped to the data? If so, what purpose do they serve ( redundancy for robustness / improve visual metaphor / but data in context / beauty / etc )?--->

<!---Are any data mapped to more than one aesthetic attribute? Why?--->

### Motion

<!---If motion is used, what purpose does it serve ( metaphor (eg representing motion in real world) / transition continuity between views / etc )--->

### Perspective

<!---To what extent is perspective (eg mappings) controlled by users vs hard coded in advance? How does this project aid in exploration vs exposition?--->

## Assessment

<!---Was the new visualization successful at providing insight that was not possible or more difficult with previous approaches?--->

<!---What are the main limitations of new approach?--->

<!---What are future directions this could go in?--->
